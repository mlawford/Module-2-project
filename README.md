# README

Food Fight is a scavenger hunt competition for foodies. Each week a new challenge is deployed and users can choose to participate. If they do, they are given a set of restaurants they should visit and write reviews. The first user to complete all the reviews in the challenge, or the user with the most reviews by the end of the challenge will be the winner and awarded 100 EXP. The top 3 foodies receive bragging rights and a spot on the leaderboard.
